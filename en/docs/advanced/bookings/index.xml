Flights are put into the ORS three days before they take off. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you activate a flight plan on Monday morning and the first flight is scheduled to take off at 11 o&amp;rsquo;clock. In that case, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait until 11 o&amp;rsquo;clock before your first flight appears on the flight list.</description></item><item><title>Demand Calculation</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/bookings/demand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/bookings/demand/</guid><description>Demand Calculation # To help you get a better understanding of how demand works in AirlineSim, here is a general Q&amp;amp;A.
Does the time of day matter when it comes to flights? # No, passengers will treat all flight departure and arrival times equally. Total travel time does affect the flight rating, though.
Does passenger demand vary seasonally? # No, seasonal changes currently don&amp;rsquo;t play a role when it comes to demand.</description></item><item><title>Flight Rating System</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/bookings/flight-rating-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/bookings/flight-rating-system/</guid><description>Flight Rating System # The Flight Rating System (FRS) is designed to provide airlines with a detailed quality evaluation of individual flights. The ratings it provides are also used to calculate the influence a flight has on the airline&amp;rsquo;s image.
The evaluation can be accessed via the Inventory or Flight Numbers page in the Commercial tab. Just click on the small white arrow next to a flight and you&amp;rsquo;ll see its Flight Information page.</description></item></channel></rss>
