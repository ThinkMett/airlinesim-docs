While you can use the first holding you establish as a regular airline, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to perform a stock market launch with it. In case you&amp;rsquo;re interested in starting an IPO, you need to create another enterprise as the daughter of your existing holding.</description></item><item><title>Immediate Delivery Program</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/immediate-delivery-program/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/immediate-delivery-program/</guid><description>Immediate Delivery Program # During the creation of your company, you may have noticed an in-game message popping up. Whenever you establish a holding in a new game world, you are greeted with a note from the Aircraft Trade and Leasing Organization (ATO) welcoming you to the Immediate Delivery Program (IDP).
This service grants you a starting budget of 10 million AS$ and is meant to get your new company off the ground and ready for the competition.</description></item><item><title>Building Your Fleet</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/building-your-fleet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/building-your-fleet/</guid><description>Building Your Fleet # With your company set up, you probably want to start leasing or buying your first aircraft. Since there is a huge variety of machines to choose from, let&amp;rsquo;s start by evaluating which aircraft type suits your planned operations best!
Choosing Planes # First, it can be helpful to decide where you want your aircraft to fly to. With some possible routes in mind, you can get a better idea of what your fleet is going to look like.</description></item><item><title>Creating Routes</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/creating-routes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/creating-routes/</guid><description>Creating Routes # You&amp;rsquo;ve successfully acquired your first aircraft, so let&amp;rsquo;s start planning your airline&amp;rsquo;s routes! After the previous steps, you might already have a rough idea of where you want to fly, but now we&amp;rsquo;ll have a look at the details.
Finding Airport Information # If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in a specific airport, you can search for it by typing its name or IATA code into the bar at the top of the screen.</description></item><item><title>Hiring Staff</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/hiring-staff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/hiring-staff/</guid><description>Hiring Staff # With the routes set up, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to your staff!
Employing Pilots # An aircraft needs pilots to fly, so we have to hire or train them first. Some crew members will already be added by default, but let&amp;rsquo;s find out how to employ pilots manually.
First, select the Management tab and go to Crew Management. On the left, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a list of the employed and required pilots, grouped together by aircraft category.</description></item><item><title>Service Profiles</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/service-profiles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/service-profiles/</guid><description>Defining Service Profiles # Crackers or Caviar? # Remember the days when airlines offered free drinks and a newspaper on every flight? It didn&amp;rsquo;t cost them much, but passengers appreciated the service.
Our virtual passengers like to be pampered, too! Fortunately, good on-board service - drinks, meals, newspapers and so on - isn&amp;rsquo;t that expensive and the higher rating is definitely worth the price.
Business and first class passengers are harder to please, but if you offer first class seats, then why not offer first class service?</description></item><item><title>Configuring the Cabins</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/cabin-configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/cabin-configuration/</guid><description>Configuring the Cabins # Before you can hit the skies, you need to equip your aircraft with a cabin and configure its seat layout - regardless of whether you own new or used machines. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it&amp;rsquo;s done!
Info
This step does not apply if you want to operate cargo aircraft. Though it&amp;rsquo;s not the best, there is a default configuration already installed in all of your new aircraft.</description></item><item><title>Assigning Cabin and Crew</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/assigning-cabin-and-crew/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/assigning-cabin-and-crew/</guid><description>Assigning Cabin and Crew # Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve set up cabins and hired staff, it&amp;rsquo;s time to assign them to your aircraft.
In the Operations tab, click on Fleet Management and pick the fleet that your aircraft is assigned to. Right now, this will probably be the default fleet which all of your purchased and leased aircraft are added to.
Next, select the aircraft in question. This opens an Actions window in which you can specify cabin and crew.</description></item><item><title>Maintenance</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/maintenance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/maintenance/</guid><description>Maintenance # Booking Maintenance # Okay, you have your aircraft, routes, service, staff and cabins all figured out - time to start flying? Not just yet, you still need a maintenance provider! Without repairs, your aircraft won&amp;rsquo;t be flying for very longâ€¦
In the Operations tab, select Maintenance and choose a maintenance company servicing your aircraft. There are several options with certain advantages and disadvantages. Every provider has different values regarding price, quality and the duration of maintenance.</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Flights</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/scheduling-flights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/scheduling-flights/</guid><description>Scheduling Flights # With the maintenance provider ready to go, it&amp;rsquo;s finally time to get your aircraft flying! This can be quite simple or a bit complicated, depending on where you are, what your airline is trying to achieve and how much competition you&amp;rsquo;re facing.
This tutorial will focus on getting a basic flight plan up and running, but a lot of the more advanced concepts should be pretty self-evident by the time you&amp;rsquo;re through with it.</description></item><item><title>Congratulations!</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/congratulations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/congratulations/</guid><description>Congratulations! # The title says it all - you have successfully completed our beginner&amp;rsquo;s guide!
