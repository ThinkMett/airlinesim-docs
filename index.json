[{"content":"General AirlineSim is a pay-to-play game that works with in-game credits, which you can buy.\nWhen you found a holding on a game world, a certain amount of credits will be deducted every 24h. If your credits balance turns negative, you won’t be able to play AirlineSim anymore, but your airline will still continue to exist, allowing you to recharge your credits still. For a trial account, the grace period is 7 days and for premium accounts it is 28 days before your airlines will be deleted after your credits balance turned negative.\nEach player has a credit account, which starts off loaded with 60 free credits on account creation. This is enough for a two-week trial period, assuming you only run one Holding. If you want to continue playing after your trial is up, or make use of game features which are only open to paid accounts, you’ll have to purchase further credits. The credit system is completely flexible; buying credits does not constitute a repeating subscription, you can buy credits whenever you like, and if you ever decide to stop playing the game all you have to do is let your credits run out. Credits can’t be refunded, though.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Payment and Credits","uri":"/airlinesim-docs/about-airlinesim/payment-credits/"},{"content":"First steps in AirlineSim We are currently creating a new tutorial for AirlineSim.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Tutorial","uri":"/airlinesim-docs/tutorial/"},{"content":"About AirlineSim In this chapter, you will find an overview of payment, game rules, game worlds and other basic information about AirlineSim.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"About AirlineSim","uri":"/airlinesim-docs/about-airlinesim/"},{"content":"AirlineSim is an aviation-related, strategic online business simulation, built to entertain and play against other real life players.

Direct costs include: Handling (Passenger, Cargo, Aircraft), Catering, Fuel, ATC Charges and Landing Fees.\nCompany Naming Rules At AirlineSim, we strive for an authentic and realistic gaming experience. We ask our players to support us in achieving this goal by choosing appropriate names for their holdings and enterprises within the game.\nThe naming rules are split into two parts:\nRules: These are strict rules that will be enforced by AirlineSim staff. Guidelines: These are recommendations that are supposed to help you picking a fitting name but are not strictly enforced. Rules The usage of the following names is prohibited:\nNames of former and existing real-world airlines. This also includes very similar names.\nExample: Hamburg Intl. (Hamburg International exists) or Air Egypt (Egypt Air exists) Exceptions: the name consists of words which are in regular use (particularly geographical terms) and the name is combined with other words like “Air Northern France” or “Indian International Airlines”. Tip: Use Google to look up your desired airline name. When there are no similar results on the first page, the name should usually be fine. Public Names\nExample: “Federal Republic of Germany”, “Army Aviation” or “Frankfurt” Illegal Names\nExample: Racist, race baiting names or names and symbols otherwise prohibited by law When illegal names are used, we reserve the right to exclude the respective user from the game immediately and without prior warning. Offensive Names\nExample: Pornographic or sexist names We reserve the right to change names without explanation or entirely remove businesses due to their choice of name. Usually, our staff will get in touch with you to find an alternative name, though.\nGuidelines AirlineSim wants to create a realistic and friendly gaming environment. Therefore, please note following guidelines and tips for choosing your airline name:\nTry to find a name for your airline which could, at least in theory, also be used in reality. Avoid names of existing brands, especially if they are registered in the transport or tourism sector. Use correct spelling. We reserve the right to correct misspelled names. Avoid names which are similar to existing companies of other players in the same game world. Avoid silly/gibberish names, abbreviations or deterministic composite names (such as GermanInternationalOutOfFrankfurtOnlyToSouthernItalyAirlines). Consider the language of the home country of your business when choosing a name and avoid the mixing of different languages.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Game rules","uri":"/airlinesim-docs/about-airlinesim/game-rules/"},{"content":"This chapter contains information and explanations about the different game features.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Basic Knowledge","uri":"/airlinesim-docs/basic-knowledge/"},{"content":"Overview You can play on as many game worlds as you like.\nShort-term game worlds These are currently Quimby, Otto and Yeager.

As a result, the same possibilities for customization as well as the same restrictions apply and settings are being managed by our support staff.\nWhat is an exclusive game world? By default, an exclusive game world allows for a maximum of 25 accounts which are specified by its owner and approved by our support staff. The number of holdings on each game world is not limited, the world’s configuration is up to its owner’s wishes. Our support can provide any amount of money to any airline on the game world, e.g. to allow for a faster start.\nWhat exactly can I configure? The following configurations are set by our support according to your wishes:\n  Nighttime bans on/off\n  Ground networks on/off\n  Single/Double slots\n  Initial public offerings on/off\n  Dynamic turnaround times on/off\n  Availability of aircraft (all / only contemporary)\n  Selection of aircraft types on the game world\n  Start with/without used aircraft\n  Global demand for passengers and cargo (1-100%)\n  List of countries open for foreign investment (also all, none)\n  Anti-Cheating restrictions on/off\n  For countries that allow for foreign investment, you can chose from the lists that are in use on public game worlds or alternatively make all or no countries at all avaiable for foreign investment.\nWith anti-cheating restrictions turned off, you are free to interact with own holdings (on the aircraft market, stock market or for interlinig contracts).\nWhat about game rules? We don’t supervise any rules on exclusive game worlds - the owner of a game world may do this to the extent they desire. We will not check naming, stock exchanges or the likes.\nSince exclusive game worlds are identical to public ones, any hard-coded restrictions - e.g. pertaining to aircraft, stock exchange or multiple own holdings - cannot be lifted.\nHow much does is cost? An exclusive game world is 360 EUR (including VAT) per 30 days. We require a non-refundable payment in advance for the first 90 days.\nWhere can I order my own game world? You can place your order directly in account management.\nIf you have any more questions prior to your order, please contact us at support@airlinesime.aero.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Exclusive game worlds","uri":"/airlinesim-docs/about-airlinesim/exclusive-game-worlds/"},{"content":"There are various channels available to you, in case you need help or have want to send us information.\nForums This is the main place for communication between players of AirlineSim.

For subsidiaries, this is usually based on the location of your holding company, or the combined amount of shares held, if your airline is a listed enterprise.\nGenerally, you can always transport passengers within your home country as well as on flight from/to you home country. If your home country has siigned a treaty, your traffic rights may be extended.\nFor Cargo flights you don’t have to worry about traffic rights - you are allowed to operate between any two airports in the world, unless there are (political) restrictions in place.\nTreaties Treaties can extend your traffic rights. In AirlineSim, there are two types or treaties available. The Eu Treaty and the Oceanic Open Skies Treaty will provide you an open market, that basically traeats all flights between any airports on the member states and domestic flights for your airline. However, if you want to offer flights to countries outside the treaty, those flights still have to be from/to your own home country. Below, you can find some illustrattions on how the treaties work.\nEU Treaty \u0026 oceanic Open Skies Yamoussoukro Decision \u0026 Caricom 5th Freedom List of countries that accept foreign investment: There are a number of countries throughout the world which allow foreign investment; the previously stated rules apply to these countries as they do to any other, but unlike countries which do not allow foreign investment, foreign holdings may - through the establishment of an enterprise based in the investment-open country - operate airlines in them, while enjoying all the rights granted to domestic holdings.\nDepending on your game world, that list of countries that accept foreign investment, will be different. You can always check the country page on your game world, to make sure what the status is. Here is a complete list of the different lists that are in use. Any new game worlds are using list C.\n   Country List A List B List C     Angola included included included   Argentina included included not included   Azerbaijan included included included   Bahamas included included included   Barbados included included included   Benin included included included   Cambodia included included included   Cameroon included included included   Chad included included included   Colombia included included not included   Costa Rica included included not included   Djibouti included included included   Dominica included included included   Dominican Republic included included not included   Ecuador included included not included   Gambia included included included   Georgia included included included   Grenada included included included   Guatemala included included included   Guinea-Bissau included included included   Honduras included included included   Iraq included included included   Ivory Coast included included included   Kazakhstan included included not included   Kenya included included not included   Kyrgyzstan included included included   Kuwait included included included   Laos included included included   Lebanon* included included included   Moldova included included included   Mongolia included included included   New Zealand included not included not included   Niger included included included   Pakistan included included not included   Panama included included not included   Papua New Guinea included included included   Paraguay included included included   Qatar included included not included   Solomon Islands included included included   Samoa included included included   Senegal included included included   Sao Tome and Principe included included included   Sierra Leone included included included   Somalia included included included   St. Kitts and Nevis included included included   St. Lucia included included not included   St. Vincent included included included   Sudan included included included   Swaziland included included included   Tanzania included included not included   Togo included included included   Tonga included included included   Trinidad and Tobago included included included   Tuvalu included included included   Uganda included included included   Ukraine included included not included   Uzbekistan included included included   Zambia included included included    *Does not apply to holding enterprises based in Israel\nPolitical restrictions There are certain country-pairs which, for political reasons, do not permit travel between each other. Other routes between specific airports that are serving the same region, can also be banned for game-play reasons.\nGo to Database \u003e Forbidden Routes on your game world to find a list of all restrictions.\nPlease note for our game world Devau, that restrictions between airports to not apply there due to a special configuration of the game world without ground networks.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Traffic rights","uri":"/airlinesim-docs/basic-knowledge/traffic-rights/"},{"content":"Introduction Aircaft are argubly the most important part of an airline. You can obtain used aircraft on the aircraft market or - in case they are still in production - new aircraft directly from the maniufaturer. For both sources, there are are three different financing options available: You can pay in cash, take a loan (with an inital down payment) or lease the aircraft (and make a security deposit for it). Leasing is the most flexibile option and highly recommended for a new airline. Taking a loan may sometimes look tempting when it offers a lower weekly payment rate, but you can’t just cancel it in case your airline runs short on cash or you simply don’t need it anymore - while leasing contracts can always be cancelled again, leasving you with no troubles.\nMaintenance damage points cash\nMaintenance Categories plus 15 percentage points\nMaintenance Providers info on\nMaintenance Ratio above 100 % keep it daily\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Aircraft and Maintenance","uri":"/airlinesim-docs/basic-knowledge/aircraft-maintenance/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Categories","uri":"/airlinesim-docs/categories/"},{"content":"Welcome to the new AirlineSim Handbook!
