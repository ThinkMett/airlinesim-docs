## Introduction
The legal home country (as listed on your airline info page) determines the traffic rights for your airline. For subsidiaries, this is usually based on the location of your holding company, or the combined amount of shares held, if your airline is a listed enterprise.

Generally, you can always transport passengers within your home country as well as on flight from/to you home country. If your home country has siigned a treaty, your traffic rights may be extended.

For **Cargo flights** you don't have to worry about traffic rights - you are allowed to operate between any two airports in the world, unless there are (political) restrictions in place.

## Treaties

Treaties can extend your traffic rights. In AirlineSim, there are two types or treaties available. The Eu Treaty and the Oceanic Open Skies Treaty will provide you an open market, that basically traeats all flights between any airports on the member states and domestic flights for your airline. However, if you want to offer flights to countries outside the treaty, those flights still have to be from/to your own home country.
Below, you can find some illustrattions on how the treaties work.

## List of countries that accept foreign investment:

There are a number of countries throughout the world which allow foreign investment; the previously stated rules apply to these countries as they do to any other, but unlike countries which do not allow foreign investment, foreign holdings may - through the establishment of an enterprise based in the investment-open country - operate airlines in them, while enjoying all the rights granted to domestic holdings.

Depending on your game world, that list of countries that accept foreign investment, will be different. You can always check the country page on your game world, to make sure what the status is.
Here is a complete list of the different lists that are in use. Any new game worlds are using list C.

## Political restrictions

There are certain country-pairs which, for political reasons, do not permit travel between each other.
Other routes between specific airports that are serving the same region, can also be banned for game-play reasons.

Go to **Database > Forbidden Routes** on your game world to find a list of all restrictions.

Please note for our game world **Devau**, that restrictions between airports to not apply there due to a special configuration of the game world without ground networks.
