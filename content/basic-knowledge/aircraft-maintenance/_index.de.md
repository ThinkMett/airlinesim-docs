## Introduction

Aircaft are argubly the most important part of an airline. You can obtain used aircraft on the aircraft market or - in case they are still in production - new aircraft directly from the maniufaturer. 
For both sources, there are are three different financing options available: You can pay in cash, take a loan (with an inital down payment) or lease the aircraft (and make a security deposit for it).
Leasing is the most flexibile option and highly recommended for a new airline. Taking a loan may sometimes look tempting when it offers a lower weekly payment rate, but you can't just cancel it in case your airline runs short on cash or you simply don't need it anymore - while leasing contracts can always be cancelled again, leasving you with no troubles.
