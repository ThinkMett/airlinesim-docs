# Community Tab

You want to connect with other players or find out about the latest game updates? The Community tab offers all the links you need.

Whether it's the [AirlineSim blog](https://www.airlinesim.aero/blog/), the [forums](https://forums.airlinesim.aero/), our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5K2Axks) or the game's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/airlinesim) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/airlinesim) page - there's lots of ways to stay in the loop and become part of our community!

The Community tab also offers a link to our second title [Prosperous Universe](https://prosperousuniverse.com/), a browser-based space economy game!
