# Private Messages

This tab grants you access to the in-game messages you have sent and received.

Messages are sorted into different mail boxes that each consist of an inbox and an outbox. Here you can reply, mark them as read or unread or delete them.

If you want to send an in-game message, look up the respective user profile and click on the message button on the top right.
