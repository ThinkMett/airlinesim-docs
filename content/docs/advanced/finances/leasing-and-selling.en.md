# Leasing and Selling

If you're interested in leasing or selling your owned planes on the aircraft market, you can go to the Fleet Management page and click on the small book icon next to your desired model. This will allow you to put your plane up for sale or lease.

Choosing either will show the associated pricing options, such as the minimum price and the bid interval. If you want to lease the aircraft to someone else, your company's equity (accounts 3000 and 3100 on the Accounting page) has to be at least 20 million AS$.

Keep in mind that the aircraft's settings, flight plan and seating will be removed once you activate the offer. If you want to keep track of your listed machines, you can check the Your Offers tab on the Aircraft Market page.
