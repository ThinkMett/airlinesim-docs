## What is AirlineSim about?

AirlineSim is a browser-based business simulation in which you can create your own virtual airline and compete for passengers in a market that operates in real time. See [Game Concept]({{< relref "docs/about/concept.md" >}}) for more details.

## How much does it cost?

The game employs a pay-to-play payment system that requires the purchase of credits. If this is your first time playing AirlineSim, your new account will be equipped with 60 credits that cover a trial period of about two weeks. This way, you can try out the game for free! For more information on prices, visit [Payment System]({{< relref "docs/about/payment/index.md" >}}).

## Where can I get started?

Before diving into the game, you need to set up an account via the [AirlineSim website](https://www.airlinesim.aero/en/). Next, choose a game world in which you want to start playing. Each game world has a different configuration, so make sure to check out [Game Worlds]({{< relref "docs/about/game-worlds/index.md" >}}) for more details. After picking a server, you're ready to create your first airline!

## What's the difference between short-term and long-term game worlds?

Short-term game worlds have a limited runtime. One iteration usually lasts about 8 to 10 months. After that, the game world is reset. Long-term game worlds don't have an end date. See [Game Worlds]({{< relref "docs/about/game-worlds/index.md" >}}) for more information.

## Is there a tutorial?

Yes! We've put together a [Beginner's Guide]({{< relref "docs/beginners-guide/introduction/index.md" >}}) to help you with your first steps in the game. There's also a lot of great tips and tutorials from our community, so don't hesitate to have a look at the [AirlineSim forums](https://forums.airlinesim.aero/) or our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5K2Axks).

## Which aircraft models can I play with?

AirlineSim offers a wide variety of aircraft for you to choose from. The exact types depend on the game world, so have a look at the server's configuration before getting started.

## How can I cooperate with other airlines?

If you want to connect with other players, you have a lot of options - from leasing out aircraft, signing interline agreements to forming alliances, anything is possible!

## Can I book my own game world?

Yes, AirlineSim offers [Exclusive Game Worlds]({{< relref "docs/about/game-worlds/index.md" >}}) that allow a custom server set up.
