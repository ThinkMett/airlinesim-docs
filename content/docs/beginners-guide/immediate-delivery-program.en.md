# Immediate Delivery Program
  
During the creation of your company, you may have noticed an in-game message popping up. Whenever you establish a holding in a new game world, you are greeted with a note from the Aircraft Trade and Leasing Organization (ATO) welcoming you to the Immediate Delivery Program (IDP).

This service grants you a starting budget of 10 million AS$ and is meant to get your new company off the ground and ready for the competition.
The advantage of these initial funds is that you can use them to lease new aircraft and get them delivered immediately.

Normally, you'd have to wait for the machines to arrive, but as long as your combined leasing deposits stay within the IDP budget, you don't have to worry about that!
