# Game Concept

AirlineSim is a realistic browser-based business simulation in which you can run your own virtual airline and compete for passengers with other players.

Use a set of comprehensive management tools to set up an aircraft fleet, create cabin configurations and schedule flight plans – all while keeping an eye on the game's real time market and adjusting price and service levels if necessary.

It's not all about competition, though: From forming alliances to signing interline agreements and leasing out aircraft – in AirlineSim, you have many ways of interacting with other players and forming connections that last.
