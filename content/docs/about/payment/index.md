# Payment System

AirlineSim utilizes a pay-to-play payment system that requires the purchase of credits in order to access the game. By avoiding in-game purchases, this payment model serves to enhance fairness and game immersion.

This article covers everything you need to know about credits, credit consumption, prices, payment methods and the gameâ€™s premium features. If you are running into problems during the payment process, please refer to Account Management: Payment FAQ.
