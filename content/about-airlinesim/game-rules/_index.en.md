## Company Naming Rules
At AirlineSim, we strive for an authentic and realistic gaming experience. We ask our players to support us in achieving this goal by choosing appropriate names for their holdings and enterprises within the game.

The naming rules are split into two parts:

Rules: These are strict rules that will be enforced by AirlineSim staff.
Guidelines: These are recommendations that are supposed to help you picking a fitting name but are not strictly enforced.
Rules
The usage of the following names is prohibited:

Names of former and existing real-world airlines. This also includes very similar names.

Example: Hamburg Intl. (Hamburg International exists) or Air Egypt (Egypt Air exists)
Exceptions: the name consists of words which are in regular use (particularly geographical terms) and the name is combined with other words like "Air Northern France" or "Indian International Airlines".
Tip: Use Google to look up your desired airline name. When there are no similar results on the first page, the name should usually be fine.
Public Names

Example: "Federal Republic of Germany", "Army Aviation" or "Frankfurt"
Illegal Names

Example: Racist, race baiting names or names and symbols otherwise prohibited by law
When illegal names are used, we reserve the right to exclude the respective user from the game immediately and without prior warning.
Offensive Names

Example: Pornographic or sexist names
We reserve the right to change names without explanation or entirely remove businesses due to their choice of name. Usually, our staff will get in touch with you to find an alternative name, though.

Guidelines
AirlineSim wants to create a realistic and friendly gaming environment. Therefore, please note following guidelines and tips for choosing your airline name:

Try to find a name for your airline which could, at least in theory, also be used in reality.
Avoid names of existing brands, especially if they are registered in the transport or tourism sector.
Use correct spelling. We reserve the right to correct misspelled names.
Avoid names which are similar to existing companies of other players in the same game world.
Avoid silly/gibberish names, abbreviations or deterministic composite names (such as GermanInternationalOutOfFrankfurtOnlyToSouthernItalyAirlines).
Consider the language of the home country of your business when choosing a name and avoid the mixing of different languages.
