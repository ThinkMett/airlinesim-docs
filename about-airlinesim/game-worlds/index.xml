The time progression is accelatrated, so that four weeks of real time equal one year of time advancement in-game. The standard game routine still runs in real time, though (as on other game worlds).
The time progression affects aircraft availability and ageing and thereby maintencance ccosts.
Aircraft types We have only included start or end years for aircraft production, if the are in the relevant 1990 to 2002 time frame.</description></item></channel></rss>
